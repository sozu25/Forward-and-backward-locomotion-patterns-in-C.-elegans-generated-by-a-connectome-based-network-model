[Descriptions of Matlab Code]
Matlab codes used in this study are listed below

 |- main_sim1.m:		The main source code to train the motor neuron and muscle network.
 |   |			This file calls the following script files
 |   |- makeNeuronList.m:	This file relates the index of neuron units and neuron name.
|   |- parameter.m:	This file defines the parameters for training 
|   |- learningRestriction.m:	This file defines restrictions, such as polarity of the synapse, for training the model parameters
|   |- makeTeacherSignal.m: This file defines input data and loads teacher data.
|   |- learningModel.m:	This file adopts the backpropagation through time algorithm to train the model.
|
|- 7feedback_AS_bf.mat: 	This data file contains a 2-dimensional matrix that defines the synaptic connection pattern.
|			The correspondence between row and collum index and neuron name is defined by 
| 			makeNeuronList.m
|- W_filt3_g_AS.mat:	This data file contains a 2-dimensional matrix that defines the gap junction pattern.
|
|- Data (folder):
     |- Measured (folder)	This folder contains parameter data trained by measured muscle activity as the teacher.
     |- Sin(folder)	This folder contains parameter data trained by a sinusoidal function as the teacher.
	#Each folder contains 10 .mat data files each corresponding to the result of one training trial.
	#Each file contains the following trained parameters:

w_: synaptic connection weight matrix
g_: gap connection weight matrix
tau_: time constant vector
hist_err: Residual error at each training iteration
min_err: Minimum residual error obtained from training
